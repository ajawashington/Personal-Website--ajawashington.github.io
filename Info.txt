I have built my career tackling many different roles in a variety of industries as an instructor, assistant, and leader to companies. Simultaneously working with a brilliant team by my side, and handling projects independently.

My life's work is committed to instilling divergent thinking to the global community; enhancing our humanity and humility. This shift in perspective begins with solving problems in a dynamic way and is what caught my interest in software development.

Technology is the leading force of our society, its powerful, accessible features grants anyone the power to influence ideas, structures, and policy at a rapid rate.

With my experience in arts & entertainment, hospitality, human instruction and study, I plan to allow my skill in software to build something focused on redefining the global idea of living and creating; influencing fruitful, invigorating lifestyles.

My dedication to growth is what drives me to change my life and the world around me.
